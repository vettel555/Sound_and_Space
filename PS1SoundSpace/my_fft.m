%Takes the N point FFT of x and multiplies by 1/fs. Shifts the reference
%output and provides the shifted frequencies for plotting. Two outputs to
%check if the FT was performed properly, and one more to check if the shift
%is like fftshift.

%Make input row vector

dt = 1/fs;
df = fs/N;
%Take FT
Xpshift = fft(x,N)*dt;
%Checking if FT was good using Parseval's
sum_check_t= sum(x.^2)*dt;
sum_check_f= (sum(abs(Xpshift).^2))*df;

%shifting X
X = my_fftshift(Xpshift, N);

%Since my shift is like fftshift, the fs/2 component goes to -fs/2, which
%should be the first element of f:
f = [-floor(N/2):-1,0:ceil(N/2)-1]*df;
